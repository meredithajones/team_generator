## Introduction
I created this Team Generator application to give users the ability to easily create a visual chart displaying their managers, engineers and interns. 
Along with listing the names and roles of these employees on visually accessible cards, based on user inputs they will also display the email addresses of each employee, the office numbers of managers, school being attended by interns, and GitHub user names for the engineers. 

## Installation
In order to run the app, you will need to run both Inquirer and Jest. If you have cloned the repository then they are already included and will just need to be run. 
In order to run Inquirer and jest, open the app.js file using the integrated terminal and type in the command "npm i". 

## Usage 
In order to run the application, run "node app.js" in the integrated terminal and enter the answers to questions being prompted regarding your team. 
Once the user has completed recording all of the employees that they would like to display, the inputs will be generated into card displays through a document located in the "output" folder titled "team.html". A user will open this file in their browser to view the completed roster of team members.
