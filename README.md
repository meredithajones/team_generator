## Technologies
<details>
<summary>Technology used to create application</summary>

* Javascript
	Javascript and Jquery were used to create the functionality of Happy Trails. We utilized AJAX to pull the necessary data from the respective APIs used for user and trail location, as well as the characteristics of the trails being referenced.

* HTML5
	The framework for structuring Happy Trail’s layout was created using HTML version 5. 

* CSS3
	We utilized the CSS framework Bulma to style the appearance of our application.

### Features
* Geolocation ability

* Local storage of user's favorite trails
* Modal to display saved favorite trails


## Project Challenges
* Initially our team was working to create an app to allow users to avoid crowded locations during our current pandemic. 
Our goal was to integrate Google’s “busy times” feature associated with stores and other destinations. Our first day of development was spent exploring API capabilities, and in the end we realized that Google’s API does not allow the information that we needed about foot traffic to be obtained from their API. We regrouped and decided to pivot to our current project to help people connect with local trails, and spend more time outdoors. 

* Another hurdle that we overcame as a team was learning to merge all of our respective work for the project into Github. When we began, it felt very complex, but now as we are nearing the end of the project we have hit a good rhythm with our pushing and pulling of content while avoiding any merge errors.
